The goal of tidyaml is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of tidyaml like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

Part of the reason to use `{tidyaml}` is so that you can generate many models of
your data set. One way of modeling a data set is using regression for some numeric
output. There is a convienent function in __tidyaml__ that will generate a set of
non-tunable models for _fast regression_. Let's take a look below.

```{r example}
library(tidyaml)

fast_regression_parsnip_spec_tbl(.parsnip_fns = "linear_reg")
fast_regression_parsnip_spec_tbl(.parsnip_eng = c("lm","glm"))
```
